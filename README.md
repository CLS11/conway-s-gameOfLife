# Conway's Game of Life

This project is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life — a zero-player game that evolves based on its initial state according to simple rules.

## Overview

Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It demonstrates how complex patterns can emerge from simple rules applied on a grid of cells.

##  Features

- Interactive grid where cells can be toggled alive or dead
- Simulation progresses generation by generation based on classic Game of Life rules:
  - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
  - Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes alive.
  - All other live cells die in the next generation.
- Pause, play, and reset controls
- Adjustable simulation speed
